		\textbf{ Type of organizations involved in creating technical specifications and standards, as well as regulations:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs): 3GPP, ETSI, ATIS, etc;
			\item Regulatory Bodys and Administrations: control spectrum use, set licenses, regulate placing on the market, award certifications, \emph{setting requirements}. Examples: ANATEL, ECC (Nationals), ITU (Global);
			\item Industry forums: promoting and lobbying for specific technologies. GSMA Association, Next Generation Mobile Networks, etc
		\end{itemize}
	
		\newpage
		\textbf{The role of ITU-R:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It's the radio communications sector of ITU;
			\item Aims at ensuring efficient and interference-free use of RF spectrum by all wireless devices;
			\item Composed of subgroups and working parties that produce reports and recommendations;
			\item Within ITU-R is the Working Party 5D (WP5D), which is responsible for the overall system aspects of International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) systems
			\item Provides \emph{Radio Interface Specifications} (RSPCs);
			\item Each recommendation contains \emph{Radio Interface Technologies} (RITs);
			\item It does not create specifications, but maintains recommendations and reports for IMT;
			\item The actual specifications are maintained by an SDO and the RSPCs provide references to the specifications
			\item Examples of RSPC:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item IMT-2000: (3G, WCDMA, etc);
				\item IMT-Advanced:  4G/LTE
				\item IMT-2020 (planned): will provide radio interface technologies for 5G.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	
		\newpage
		\textbf{IMT Process in ITU-R WP5D}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Looks for future roles and trends;
			\item Set future usage scenarios (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)
			\item At World Radio Conference (WRC) 2015 new bands for IMT were discussed;
			\item Publication of technical requirements, evaluation guideline, submission template (for candidate technology)
		\end{enumerate}
